## About
Filer is a lightweight file and folder search tool and launcher for Windows. With a focus on making searches easy and the prioritization of relevant search results, it is capable of quickly indexing and searching for any files folders on the system.

#### Main features

+ The ability to "favorite" or "suppress" any file or folder. Favoriting a file promotes it in future searches while suppressing it does the opposite.
+ Complete control over which folders are indexed. Indexing everything on the system introduces a ton of irrelevant search results so Filer only indexes the folders you want it to.
+ A file extension block list that allows for any number of file extensions to be excluded from search results.
+ "Follow the mouse" mode for multi-monitor setups, which makes filer appear on whichever monitor the mouse is currently on.
+ Relative positioning, meaning Filer will appear in the same relative position on every monitor in a multi-monitor setup, even if the monitors have different sizes and resolutions.
+ Floating design that allows Filer to be opened from anywhere using its global hotkey—ALT+Space—and to automatically hide itself again after searches or when focus is lost.
+ Keyboard-only operation. Filer is designed so that searches can be easily performed without needing any mouse input.
+ Support for narrowing searches to only files or only folders using built-in search filters.
+ Automatic monitoring of all indexed folders. Newly created files are instantly indexed while deleted and moved files are dealt with accordingly. Every indexed folder can also be manually scanned at any time in case a file is missed.

#### Installation
Filer is a fully portable application so no installation is required. Simply extract the program files to a folder and run the executable.
